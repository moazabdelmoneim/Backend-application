# Backend-application
Backend app for anonymous messages  
An innovative platform where users can send and receive messages anonymously while ensuring security, scalability, and performance.

ðŸš€ Features

Database & Architecture
	â€¢	NoSQL Database: Built using MongoDB with Mongoose for scalability and flexibility.
	â€¢	Event-Driven Architecture: Utilized Node.jsâ€™s events module to optimize performance and enhance response times.

Secure Authentication & Authorization
	â€¢	Middleware: Ensures only authenticated and authorized users can access specific resources.
	â€¢	Email Verification: Secure email token (using JWT) or OTPs (using nanoId) for email confirmation.
	â€¢	Password & OTP Security: All passwords and OTPs are hashed with bcrypt, while phone numbers are encrypted using CryptoJS for maximum security.

Account Management
